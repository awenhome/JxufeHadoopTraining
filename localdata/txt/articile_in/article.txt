We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support. We are non-paid
 volunteers who help out with the project and we do not necessarily have the time or energy
to help people on an individual basis. Instead, we have setup mailing lists for each module
which often contain hundreds of individuals who will help answer detailed requests for
help. The benefit of using mailing lists over private communication is that it is a shared
resource where others can also learn from common mistakes and as a community we all grow
together.
